        including academic and infrastructure-related concerns. During these interactions, 
        it became apparent that there were significant issues surrounding the college's 
        infrastructure. On a positive note, I observed the seamless operation of the Medical Guild in 
        fulfilling its responsibilities. \n\n
An intriguing opportunity
presented itself one day when, while supervising a university exam,
    I noticed a substantial number of students proudly donning Ananda
College T-shirts. Post-exam, I engaged with them and proposed the
idea of establishing an Engineers’ Guild. Their enthusiastic
response led to the swift drafting of a constitution. Through
multiple discussions and consultations, we finalized the draft and
convened meetings with senior engineers at the Siyawasa Building.
    Their valuable input contributed to refining the constitution,
    ultimately giving rise to the "Old Anandian Engineers’ Guild"
(OAEG). This process unfolded between late 2016 and early 2017.
\n\n
Subsequently, I embarked on a sabbatical, spending over a year in
the USA and Australia. During my absence, the team diligently
concluded the constitution, officially establishing the OAEG with my
    overseas blessings. Special recognition goes to Eng. Kithsiri
Gunasekara, the inaugural president, who skillfully guided the OAEG
to its current stature. Eng. Shiran Perera further elevated the
OAEG, solidifying its indispensability within the college.
\n\n
The Students’ Chapter of the OAEG has emerged as a driving force,
    effectively managing and contributing to OAEG projects both within
the college and the broader community.`

        It is my honor to share a few words about the Old Anandian Engineers' Guild (OAEG) as its inaugural 
        President. The official formation of OAEG in 2017 was the culmination of numerous discussions and a 
        widely recognized need among Ananda engineers for such a guild. The actual establishment, however, 
        was sparked by the initiative of Prof. Udeni Nawagamuwa and his students at the University of Moratuwa. 
        I vividly recall the dedication of Prof Nawagamuwa, Dr. Malaka, Randika, Chamith, and Tharuka in turning 
        that collective dream into reality. The Guild's first Annual General Meeting and launch event, held with
         great flair at Kingsbury Hotel, was a testament to the tireless efforts of everyone involved. 
         I apologize for any omissions in acknowledging these contributions.
        \n\n
        I had the privilege of being the first appointed, rather than elected, President of the Guild. 
        Over the past six years, OAEG has evolved significantly, becoming a key affiliated group of the 
        Ananda Old Boys Association. The increasing volume of engineering consultancy requests from our 
        alma mater speaks volumes about the Guild's significance.\n\n
But our commitment extended beyond just consulting; we also focused on mentoring undergraduate engineers 
from Ananda, aiming to elevate them to prominent industry positions. It's gratifying to see this trend 
continuing, starting with our initial discussion on "What it Takes to Become a CEO."\n\n

Furthermore, OAEG initiated a scholarship program and career guidance for Ananda students. 
But probably, the most impactful program, however, was "Sahurdha Saviya," led by OAEG undergraduates, 
to support Advanced Level students. The remarkable improvement in physical science results during its 
implementation year, while not solely attributable, probably was partly influenced by this initiative.
\n\n
Despite the obstacles brought on by COVID-19, notably the hindrance of face-to-face gatherings, 
I must commend the remarkable resilience and unwavering dedication of the successive presidents and 
office bearers. Their efforts have been instrumental in maintaining the vitality and activity of the
 Guild. Under the adept leadership of Eng. Shiran Perera followed by Prof Udeni Nawagamuwa, their 
 contributions have been nothing short of exemplary, surpassing what I managed to achieve during my tenure.
\n\n
As the founding President, I extend my best wishes to OAEG, its current President Prof. 
Udeni Nawagamuwa, the office bearers, and future executive committee members. Finally, 
I must express my gratitude to the OAEG student body for their exceptional commitment 
and contributions to the Guild's success.`

Serving as the Joint Secretary in 2020/21, I honed my leadership skills and benefited from the Guild's focus on soft skills and professional conduct. Giving back to our school through the 'Intro to Robotics' course was especially rewarding, allowing me to share my passion for robotics with young minds eager to learn.
Moreover, speaking at the 'Pathway to Engineering' programs allowed me to inspire and encourage budding engineers. These experiences not only contributed to my personal growth but also reinforced my commitment to fostering a supportive and dynamic engineering community.
\n\n
I am grateful for the mentorship, opportunities, and experiences provided by the Old Anandian Engineers’ Guild. It's been a privilege to be part of an organization that continually strives for excellence and community upliftment.`
