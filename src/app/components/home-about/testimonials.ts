        "quote": `Upon my return from higher studies, I frequented Ananda College for various purposes, 
        including academic and infrastructure-related concerns. During these interactions, 
        it became apparent that there were significant issues surrounding the college's 
        infrastructure. On a positive note, I observed the seamless operation of the Medical Guild in 
        fulfilling its responsibilities. \n\n
An intriguing opportunity
presented itself one day when, while supervising a university exam,
    I noticed a substantial number of students proudly donning Ananda
College T-shirts. Post-exam, I engaged with them and proposed the
idea of establishing an Engineers’ Guild. Their enthusiastic
response led to the swift drafting of a constitution. Through
multiple discussions and consultations, we finalized the draft and
convened meetings with senior engineers at the Siyawasa Building.
    Their valuable input contributed to refining the constitution,
    ultimately giving rise to the "Old Anandian Engineers’ Guild"
(OAEG). This process unfolded between late 2016 and early 2017.
\n\n
Subsequently, I embarked on a sabbatical, spending over a year in
the USA and Australia. During my absence, the team diligently
concluded the constitution, officially establishing the OAEG with my
    overseas blessings. Special recognition goes to Eng. Kithsiri
Gunasekara, the inaugural president, who skillfully guided the OAEG
to its current stature. Eng. Shiran Perera further elevated the
OAEG, solidifying its indispensability within the college.
\n\n
The Students’ Chapter of the OAEG has emerged as a driving force,
    effectively managing and contributing to OAEG projects both within
the college and the broader community.`
